# jebrjf
welcome to jebrjf! yes that name is final and i am not taking suggestions.

jebrjf is a game where you play as a very excited kamaitachi who is always jumping, and are trying to defeat as many thundermuffins as you can.
the game can be played infinitely and only stops when you are hit by a thundermuffin

# controls
**a and d** for moving left and right
**space** to shoot
and thats it!

wow
isnt that a cool game
